<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">

This code uses Tailwind CSS gradient classes.  However, if the `from-` and `to-` colors are too similar, the gradient might be barely visible or not appear as expected.  This is not technically an error, but rather an unexpected visual result stemming from subtle color differences.
